# Evidence‑Based Smoking Cessation Strategies & Resources for PLWH

This document compiles smoking cessation interventions and resources that are particularly relevant for People Living with HIV (PLWH). All recommendations are based on current clinical guidelines and research.

## Pharmacological Interventions

### Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)
- **Nicotine patches**: Provide steady nicotine delivery; available over‑the‑counter.
- **Nicotine gum/lozenges**: Offer acute craving relief; OTC.
- **Nicotine inhaler/nasal spray**: Prescription‑only; mimic smoking behavior.
- **Considerations for PLWH**: No known interactions with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Start with standard dosing; adjust based on smoking frequency.

### Prescription Medications
- **Bupropion SR (Zyban)**: An atypical antidepressant that reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms.
  - *Dosage*: 150 mg daily for 3 days, then 150 mg twice daily.
  - *Interactions*: Minimal with ART; monitor for neuropsychiatric side effects.
- **Varenicline (Chantix)**: Partial nicotine receptor agonist that reduces pleasure from smoking and alleviates withdrawal.
  - *Dosage*: Titrate over one week; then 1 mg twice daily.
  - *Interactions*: Not known to interfere with ART; may cause nausea, vivid dreams.
- **Important**: Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any medication, especially for PLWH on complex ART regimens.

## Behavioral & Psychosocial Interventions

### Individual Counseling
- **Motivational Interviewing (MI)**: Client‑centered approach to enhance readiness to quit.
- **Cognitive‑Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Teaches coping skills to manage triggers and cravings.
- **Telephone quitlines** (e.g., 1‑800‑QUIT‑NOW) offer free, confidential counseling.

### Group Therapy & Peer Support
- **Smoking‑cessation groups** specifically for PLWH can address HIV‑related stressors.
- **Peer‑led support** improves engagement and provides relatable role models.

### Digital & Technology‑Based Tools
- **Mobile apps**: *QuitGuide* (CDC), *Smoke Free*, *QuitStart*.
- **Text‑message programs**: *SmokefreeTXT* (NCI) sends tailored messages.
- **Web‑based programs**: *Freedom From Smoking* (American Lung Association), *BecomeAnEX*.
- **Telehealth visits** for remote counseling and prescription management.

## Community & Environmental Resources

### Local Programs
- **Health department smoking‑cessation classes**.
- **HIV service organizations** often integrate tobacco‑cessation support.
- **Faith‑based and community‑center initiatives**.

### Workplace & Insurance Benefits
- Many employers offer free cessation counseling and medications.
- Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance often cover NRT and prescription drugs (check individual plans).

## Special Considerations for PLWH

### Interactions with ART
- Most smoking‑cessation medications have no clinically significant interactions with common ART regimens.
- However, a pharmacist or HIV specialist should review the patient’s full medication list before starting any new drug.

### Comorbidities & Side Effects
- PLWH may have higher rates of depression, substance use, or cardiovascular disease.
- Bupropion may be beneficial for those with depression but requires monitoring.
- Varenicline may be preferred for patients with cardiovascular risk (discuss with provider).

### Adherence & Support
- Link smoking‑cessation efforts with routine HIV care visits.
- Use pill boxes, reminders, and adherence counseling to support medication use.
- Encourage social support from family, friends, or support groups.

## Recommended Reading & Guidelines
- **Clinical Practice Guideline**: *Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence* (U.S. Public Health Service, 2008 update).
